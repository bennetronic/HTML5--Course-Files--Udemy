      <h1>Cheese Graters</h1>
        <p>Several types of graters feature different sizes of grating slots, and can therefore aid in the <span class="emphasize">preparation of a variety of foods.</span> They are commonly used to grate cheese and lemon or orange peel (to create zest), and can also be used to grate other soft foods.</p>
        <p>They are commonly used in the preparation of toasted cheese, <span>Welsh rarebit</span>, and dishes which contain cheese sauce such as macaroni and cheese, cauliflower cheese.</p>
